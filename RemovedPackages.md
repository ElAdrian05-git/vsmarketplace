# History of Extensions Removed from VS Marketplace

Security of the extension ecosystem is a top priority investment for VS Marketplace. 
Every package entering VS Marketplace is scanned upfront and regularly rescanned to prevent malware. See [Marketplace Protections](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-runtime-security#_marketplace-protections).
Scanning is not perfect. Community partnership is a very valuable part of the overall effort to keep developers safe. We take reports seriously, investigate carefully and prioritize speed of removal of positives to prevent adverse impact to the community. Thanks for your contribution!
